Something seems to have shifted this year. 

Not the usual ‘we’re all busy’, something heavier. People seem more maxed out in a way that’s hard to ignore. Conversations kept short. Commitment avoidance. Message replies slower and slower. Everyone looks overloaded, in a quiet, persistent drain.

This didn’t start in 2025. The free fall began when smartphones, Netflix and social media turned our attention into a buffet. 

This year feels like a breaking point, where the background hum of distraction suddenly became the main event. People have dropped off or reduced their online time. 

Even noticeable in work. Clients want things faster than ever, but with less room for thought. Speed has replaced depth, not because people don’t care, but because they literally don’t have the headspace to slow down or keep on top of the detail. Everyone’s overloaded, so everything becomes a rush.

The shelf life of anything we make has collapsed too. Attention is so maxed out things just don’t have the same impact. Even meaningful things can pass through people like water.

That’s the part that feels new. Being present is becoming effortful. It feels like a novelty not a default. Caring and listening takes energy we often don’t seem to have.

This isn’t a rant, but it feels like we’re crossing a line where attention is so fractured that connection, craft are both becoming accidental. 

If this is the new baseline, the real question is what we lose next.
