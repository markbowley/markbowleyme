I’ve been thinking a lot about where this is heading, and this is my honest take on 2026—especially if you’re a creator.

AI makes output cheap.

Design, coding, writing, “making things” in general—none of that is scarce anymore. The tools are better, faster, and more accessible every month. That’s not controversial. That’s just reality.

And when output gets cheap, the value moves.

### Where the Value *Isn’t* Anymore

By 2026, I don’t think the edge belongs to:

- People who ship the most
- People who automate the hardest
- People who proudly remove themselves from the process

That race is already overcrowded—and it’s accelerating toward sameness.

If everyone can make anything, making *more* isn’t the advantage.

### So What Actually Matters?

I think 2026 rewards a different kind of creator.

People who:

- Slow down while everyone else speeds up
- Develop judgment and taste—not just better prompts
- Know when *not* to use AI
- Build things from real feeling, context, and experience

This isn’t anti-AI. It’s anti-default.

Templates are useful. Automation is useful. But when everything starts from the same place, it all ends up feeling the same too.

### Specific Beats Scalable

Indie creators, especially, don’t win by being scalable-by-default.

They win by being:

- Specific instead of generic
- Opinionated instead of optimized
- Human instead of frictionless

Doing some things manually on purpose isn’t inefficiency—it’s differentiation.

Taste doesn’t scale cleanly. Judgment doesn’t come from prompts. Trust is built slowly, through consistency and restraint.

### What I’m Doing Differently

Lately, I’ve been more intentional with what I make—and what I *don’t*.

Fewer things. Smaller things. Clearer ideas.

That’s what I’m experimenting with on **minitools.carrd.co**: small, useful creations that come from paying attention, not chasing volume.

No grand platform play. No growth hacks. Just useful, thoughtful work.

### My Bet on 2026

When everyone can create anything, the real advantage is knowing:

- what’s worth making
- who it’s actually for
- and why it should exist at all

That’s not something you can fully automate.

Curious how others see 2026 shaking out—especially if you’re building independently.
