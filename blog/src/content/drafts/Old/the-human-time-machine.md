Bear with me, this one’s a bit philosophical. I tend to end up in that area a lot…

It occured to me recently that much of people’s unhappiness is down to thinking about the future, or the past. Particularly the future. What might happen. If things will turn out ok. Over optimising and worrying. 

Yet conversely, if we don’t look at the future, how can we have faith everything’s going to be ok? If we stay in the moment, not dwell on the future, how can we work on our faith in the future?
