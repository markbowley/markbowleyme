I believe that humans will reject the idea of widespread AI generated content (if it's still able to). Whilst AI may sound like it cares, understand us, thinks like us - it cannot genuinely do so. And we will come to notice the lack of compassion in its created content.

After all, what makes us human (and the richness of our experiences) is the ability to suffer, in the broad sense of the term (something which only occurs in the lives of sentient beings).

AI cannot suffer, it can only learn from the reactions of people who have 'suffered' - their writing, their art, and so on.
