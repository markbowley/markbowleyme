No-code web tools are making it easier and easier for anyone to build or edit. Whilst this is fantastic in that it democratises and lowers barriers, it has its drawbacks in the workplace. 

In marketing teams, it means roles can end up blurred. 

Often, too many people want to edit the company website – because it’s quicker and easier than explaining needs to someone, or following a process. This is especially the case in startups, where team members are often wearing many hats or working with blurred boundaries anyway.

It’s something I notice often as a freelancer and consultant, interacting with client company employees. Processes, whilst creating background efficiency, can feel like friction in people’s day to day jobs. The benefits are not always noticeable to the individual, and so require discipline. As pressure on employees’ increases, that discipline is often the first thing to fail.

All of this can result in a messy, disjointed or inneffcient website. Especially as a young company grows. 

One benefit of Webflow as a platform, is you can keep a little bit of separation between internal stakeholders and publishing capability. This is because it has a slightly more technical interface and structure. It may be no-code, but it's routed in HTML and CSS. Without knowing those, you're probably not editing correctly. Of course, you can set people up with the Editor instead of the Designer, but this is quite limited and doesn't always satisfy people used to editing on platforms like WordPress, say in a previous role.
