One of the frameworks I've used in nearly 20 years of freelancing is what I call the Three P's.

It helps when unsure if a project is a good fit. Those times where you just can't decide, because it feels like somethings not quite right but you also don't want to turn it down.

This is how it works.

A project has to have minimum of 1, at least 2, and ideally 3 of these:

Passion
A cause or topic I personally believe in, that I would want to help with even if I wasn't being paid well.

Profit
Not in the literal sense, but a healthy amount of budget so that I'm being paid well for the work, time and effort.

Portfolio
It's likely to result in my growth - either by a portfolio piece, requiring me to learn a skill I need, or where there could be lessons to learn/share.
