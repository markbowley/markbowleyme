The Small Bets community mantra is that we learn a lot more from small wins than from big failures. So in late 2022 I decided to take a small bet on a side project of mine.

It's a small, niche website I set up originally as a directory for a piece of software I use. Noticing two things.

First, there was a lack of resources online, I decided to go after this market gap. Second, the software itself was in a growth trajectory – recently moving from bootstrapped to funding.

Marketing To get a single page directory site to rank in Google,

With so much focus on social media marketing these days, it's easy to forget something important – social content  requires constant work, whereas SEO content compounds.

And, as it turns out, slow and steady effort works when it comes to SEO.

Just over a year ago I decided on an experiment with a side project, having always been guilty of expecting quick returns like everyone else.

I spent 2023 putting in regular, manageable  work on a small niche site of mine  – like a micro habit. Now, that seems to be compounding.

Monthly site traffic is growing faster in 2024, without increasing how much content I add.

The site will soon hit monthly stats of 2k page views and 400 clicks from Google (for comparison, Nov was 1.4k views and 130 clicks).

These aren't huge numbers – it's a niche site after all. But for me, it's incredibly validating to see.

Much of this has been achieved simply, through regularly:

– Adding relevant content (1  article/wk)

– Making tiny SEO tweaks & improvements

So from now on I'm taking SEO much more seriously on side projects. Got to get past that initial expectation and keep going.
