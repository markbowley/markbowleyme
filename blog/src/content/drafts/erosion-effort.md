Remember 2020? 

No, not for *that* reason.

I mean for launching online indie products. Back then, simply having a live URL was impressive. Launch a product, share the link, and people would explore it with curiosity and patience. 

Those days are gone.

Today’s landscape demands something different. As product builders, we're now in the hand-holding business. Users increasingly need to be guided through every step, every feature, every click. They have little patience for anything that doesn’t instantly change their life. 

People don't want to think too hard. Netflix, for instance, is drastically dumbing down their content for 2026 and beyond. They've seen their data: on the whole, audiences want simpler, more digestible experiences, with less cognitive load.

Big platforms have created users who expect more while being willing to invest less. Users expect instant gratification and zero friction.

What does this mean for us independent builders and designers? We're expected to deliver polished, guided experiences that match the resources of large companies. But most don't have their budgets, teams, or time. There’s an ever-widening gap, which stifles independent creativity.

It’s unfortunate, but not going away. These are the new constraints we have to work with.
