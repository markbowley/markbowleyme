You’re probably making more progress than you think. You just don’t have any proof.

Your brain is great at one thing: remembering what *didn’t* get done.
The awkward moment. The missed opportunity. The thing that’s still unfinished.

What it’s terrible at? Keeping track of small wins.

So the default story becomes: *“I’m not really moving forward.”*
Which is usually completely wrong.

Most progress is unremarkable:

- you did the thing instead of overthinking it
- you made something slightly better than yesterday
- you kept going when no one was watching

If you don’t write that down, it disappears.

I made [Winnny](https://winnny.com) for one reason: to create a record of evidence for myself.

Not goals. Not affirmations. Actual facts that you showed up and moved things forward.

Log a win.
Tomorrow, your future self sees it.
One week later, there’s a pattern.
Six months later, there’s momentum.

Motivation is unreliable, and memory is worse.

So Winnny helps you see the progress you’d otherwise forget.
