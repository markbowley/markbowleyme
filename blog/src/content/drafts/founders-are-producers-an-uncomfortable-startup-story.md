I’m about halfway through watching *The Offer* — the TV series about getting *The Godfather* made — and it’s one of those shows that sneaks up on you.

On the surface, it’s a Hollywood story.

But really, it’s an ultimate startup story. One that’s unusually honest about how hard it is to get *anything* meaningful shipped.

It tells the uncomfortable truth: good ideas are common. Alignment is the real product.

### The founder isn’t the visionary

In *The Offer*, the closest thing to a “founder” isn’t the director or the writer.

It’s the producer.

He’s operating in a world full of strong opinions, fragile egos, money pressure, politics, and fear. Everyone around him behaves like an IC — brilliant, opinionated, and focused on their own lane.

Except him.

The producer is equal parts:

- creative visionary
- financial negotiator
- language translator
- personal therapist
- bulldozer

Not because he wants to be.
Because if he isn’t, the thing simply doesn’t get made.

### Alignment is the work

What struck me most is how little time is spent “being creative” compared to everything else.

Most of the effort goes into:

- keeping the core idea intact
- translating between people who don’t speak the same language
- negotiating trade-offs without killing momentum
- absorbing uncertainty so others can keep moving

That’s not a film problem.
That’s a startup problem.

This is where the romantic idea of the founder-as-visionary quietly breaks down.

Vision alone doesn’t ship.
Someone has to carry it through conflict, compromise, and exhaustion.

### Why visionaries end up doing the real job

Here’s the part that feels especially familiar.

Visionaries often end up doing the *main* job by accident.

Not because they’re the loudest or the smartest — but because they’re the ones who notice when things stop lining up.

Clarity, alignment, scope, trade-offs, and momentum — that’s the real work.

And when no one explicitly owns it, someone implicitly does.

Often, it’s the person who can see the whole system at once.

### The quiet takeaway

*The Offer* is a reminder that making something that exists in the world — whether it’s a film or a startup — isn’t about having the best idea.

It’s about protecting the idea long enough for reality to stop trying to kill it.

If this resonates, it’s probably because you’ve felt it.

You’re not “doing too much.”
You’re not failing at delegation.

You’re doing the producer’s job.

And without it, nothing ships.
