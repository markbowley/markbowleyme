I saw a post from Dan Koe recently that stopped me mid-scroll:

“The ultimate moat, or the final competitive edge worth paying for, in my opinion, is an opinion. A perspective that only you can see, because the uniqueness of your life experience created it. That may just be the last thing anyone else can replicate.”

He's right. In a world of infinite content, original thinking is scarce.

Tools are rented advantages. AI tools. Automation tools. Growth tools. Everyone has access to the same stack. Someone’s always building a better version, a cheaper version, a faster version.

Your perspective? That's owned.

Your taste. Your lived experience. The weird combination of things you've worked on that nobody else has in quite the same order.
If there’s one thing worth doubling down on right now, it’s THAT.

But how do you actually develop perspective? Not by “finding your niche”.

That’s backward thinking. It assumes your perspective already exists in some neat, marketable category.

Real perspective comes from following your interests. Yes, even the ones that don’t obviously connect—and creating things at the intersections.

The designer who reads philosophy builds different products than the designer who doesn’t.
The marketer who dabbles in carpentry writes different copy than the one who only reads marketing books.
The founder who studied biology approaches problems differently than the one who came up through finance.

Those combinations, those intersections, that’s where original thinking lives.

It’s messy. It doesn’t fit on a LinkedIn profile. It can’t be replicated by someone following a course or copying your toolkit.
And since that’s always been the case, why not prioritize it NOW? Especially when automation is at our doorstep?

What interests are you exploring right now that don't neatly fit your job title?
