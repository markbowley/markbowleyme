I’ve written before about the [new blogging tool I use](moving-my-blog-to-inspire-myself-to-write), and how it’s inspired me to write more. What’s even more helpful about it is you can add it to any website, and still manage it independently. No need to integrate, or create a new website. 

### Why would you need to add a blog?

Let’s say you have a business website already. Adding a blog to your website is a great way to show your expertise, build thought leadership, and attract new customers. It also gives you a platform to share your company’s story, announce new product launches, and much more.

However, it can be quite technical to add a blog to an existing site, or require going through your web agency. Either way it can take up a lot of resources and time.

Another issue is you may not want the front-end website manager/s involved with the blog, and vice versa. They can often have different teams running them, with different priorities. Separating them can set helpful boundaries. 

### How to add a blog to your website, independently

One way of getting around these issues is with a [Feather](https://feather.so/?via=mark) blog. It’s a blog management tool where you create and publish content in [Notion](https://notion.grsm.io/od3nu076urdz). This makes the writing workflow much simpler, and doesn’t require you to be involved in, or knowing how to use your comany’s main website platform.

I already have two blogs running on Feather – this one you’re reading, and also [starrt.co/blog](http://starrt.co/blog) (a content site about the web builder, Carrd). Whilst I have my personal blog on a separate domain, there are two options for adding a [Feather](https://feather.so/?via=mark) blog to any existing website, independently. 

**Option 1 – on a subdomain (e.g blog.website.com)** 

The subdomain route is nice and neat as a separate company blog, and is easy to set up. However, any SEO benefit does not apply to your main website. Google sees subdomains as separate sites, so the blog and front-end website would rank separately. 

Adding a Feather blog as a **s**ubdomain is easy, and can be done via the controls in your Feather dashboard.

**Option 2 – on a subdirectory (e.g website.com/blog)**

To get the proper SEO benefit, you should use the subdirectory option. It’s a little more involved and technical to set this up, but nothing too complicated if you follow the steps. As [Feather](https://feather.so/?via=mark) is new, you will probably need to ask the founder how to do this set up. He’s very helpful and quick to respond, so don’t be afraid to do this.

📌 Note: whilst the management of the blog is independent from the main website, the subdirectory option does require you to move your website DNS to Cloudflare. You may need to talk to whoever manages your website in order to do this.

Once you have it set up, you have a fully functional blog live on your website and you can start adding content via your [Notion](https://notion.grsm.io/od3nu076urdz) account!

☑️ One other tip: if you get the navigation set up correctly on both [Feather](https://feather.so/?via=mark) and your main site, switching between the two can seem more seamless to the user. You can see this in action on my site [starrt.co](https://starrt.co), which is a Carrd website with a Feather blog located on a subdirectory.
