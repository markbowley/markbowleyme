I am a little late to the AI coding party, I know. Does it matter? No. 

The reason is I haven’t really had the time in the last few months. Or the motivation. I wanted things to settle down a bit before I dipped in. Probably an introvert’s instinct.

Recently though, I’ve had a go. I just built a few tiny humble little projects to experiment with. 

First was a flag quiz in JavaScript, built in a few hours.

I didn’t use your typical ‘vibe coding’ app either. I’ve gone the ‘assisted coding’ route so far. 

I used ChatGPT most of the time, with a quick detour to Claude. Both were brilliant… and both happily produced broken code, rewrote things that were fine, and occasionally invented things I didn’t ask for.

Some of this was on me. I asked it to handle a multi-file setup all at once whilst using the free plan. But you learn its limits and have fun. Hey ho.

Second was a simple directory. This uses a Google Sheet and displays it on a web page as a filterable directory. It’s something I [need](https://x.com/markbowley/status/1956289593923227858) actually. This one took about 1 hour to get a demo working.

Every wrong turn taught me something I’d never have looked up otherwise. I even tackled my first Git deployments. Using VSCode and Cloudflare Pages, I pushed my code, and my [flag quiz](https://world-flags-quiz.pages.dev/) and [directory demo](https://easy-directory1.pages.dev/) were live. 

Third, I’ve just made my own personal [word and character counter](https://word-counter.carrd.co/), (with a Read Time estimate built in).

The whole experience felt like a snapshot of coding in the AI era:

- The tools are powerful, but not perfect.
- You still need to understand the code (a bit).
- Patience is a bigger asset than speed.

Sure, I could’ve built it all by hand but I wouldn’t have learned half as much.

For now, onwards and hopefully [building more things](what-launching-experiments-really-teaches-you).
