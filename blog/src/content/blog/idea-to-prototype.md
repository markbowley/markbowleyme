I’ve been on a bit of a [prototyping](combining-design-sensibility-with-technical-confid) streak. I’ve made about 15 in the last month.

Instead of overthinking big projects, I’ve been focusing on small tools that solve a clear problem. Things people would actually use day to day. 

It’s a way to keep learning, stay sharp, and see what resonates with people without sinking months into development.

Here are three I’m excited about right now:

### 1. Clocks Dash

A one-page dashboard to track time zones for remote teams or family. Each city shows as a big digital clock, with the background shifting between day and night. No logins, no friction — the browser remembers your setup, and you can even make it your start page.

### 2. Sticky Notes

Sometimes you don’t want a whole productivity system — you just want sticky notes on a screen. I built a simple embeddable notes tool that lets you do exactly that. Lightweight, visual, and flexible.

### 3. Tracker Widget

A GitHub-style activity tracker you can embed anywhere, powered by Google Sheets. It’s perfect for accountability streaks and side-project tracking, without writing a line of code.

Here’s an actual live embed:

Each of these started as an experiment, but I’ve found them useful too.

I’m not sure yet which one will grow into a “real” product. Maybe one, maybe none, maybe all three. For now, I just wanted to share what I’ve been tinkering with.

If any of them catch your eye, let me know. I’d love feedback on what feels most useful.
