Earlier this year, I started an experiment with an [SEO-driven directory site](https://freeappsai.com/). The idea was simple enough – target a specific, in-demand keyword and see what kind of traffic I could generate.

Now, just over six months later I can say it worked. 

The site is closing in on 8K page views per month, which is beyond anything I’ve achieved to date. It’ll most likely hit 10K/mo before the year is out. Organic clicks from Google are at 2.6K/mo.

So it leads to to question, what do I do with this? 

I'm not making any revenue yet, although [that wasn’t in my thoughts when I started](https://medium.com/tiny-seo-lessons/keyword-success-taught-me-a-valuable-seo-lesson-915ed2c8d625). I was just trying to learn to get sites ranking.

Now I’ve validated the idea, really I should move on to the next logical step – sell or monetise.

Not as simple as it sounds, as I didn’t put much thought into the commercial viability when I researched the idea.  

Here’s a few things I’ve tried, and other ideas I could use:

### Site sponsors

General site sponsors aren’t that keen due to the word ‘free’ in the name. They don’t think it’s a good investment if users are only after free stuff. I think this is shortsighted, but I get their concerns. It’s not worth fighting it.

### Affiliate links

These are working, but they only deliver revenue once people upgrade pay the free tiers. Which is not their priority as they’ve come here for free apps. 

### Upgrades

I've offered listing upgrades for $, but have had no takers so far. I will experiment with the pricing a bit more here, as I set it fairly high to start with.

### Other ideas

1. Put ads on the top traffic pages. Offering ads to the competitors of the apps most viewed could work. Some of these are getting 300+ views/mo, so it’s a worthwhile idea.
2. Create my own education material, both free and paid. This would be lot more work, but could be a better long term business plan.
3. Sell the site in the coming months to someone who wants the traffic or data.

So I've [learned a few lessons here](https://medium.com/tiny-seo-lessons/keyword-success-taught-me-a-valuable-seo-lesson-915ed2c8d625) for sure. Not that I had any expectations when I started this project. I will keep pushing to see what I can do with it for the time being. 

It’s a new and nice problem to have, to be honest. Normally I’m busy chasing early traffic on new side projects, so to have a project with good traffic means I can experiment and learn in other ways.
