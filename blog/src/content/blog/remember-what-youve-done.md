I've been rebuilding my personal profile site lately. A simpler, fresher version to replace a larger one that’s no longer fit for my business focus.

What I noticed is that while pulling everything together, I ended up going through your work, achievements, and feedback. You’re forced to read, consider and contemplate your content.

As a creative, it's funny how much good stuff piles up, quietly sitting there. Projects that went well, clients who were genuinely happy, problems solved that looked impossible at first. It's all there, but I almost never look at it.

I've helped clients out of messy technical corners, sorted out tricky visual communications, even picked up a few awards along the way. 

I've led projects, delivered consistently, and made things that actually worked and solved problems. 

It's easy to focus on what's not working. The hard clients, the gaps, the “should've done betters”. The projects that got scrapped, or only lasted a while after launch. As creatives we can end up chasing the next thrill, or next validation.

We should probably spend more time looking at what has worked.

There's a lot there to be proud of.
