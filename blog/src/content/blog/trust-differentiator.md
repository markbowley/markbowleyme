### When you get right down to it, there’s one thing more important than price if you want to stand out.

Whether you’re building products, running a business, or looking for a job. People will pay what it takes the more they trust that you/the product/the business will get the job done, reliably.

Let’s take freelancing as an example. I’ve been working this way for a loooong time.

The longer I’ve been in the game, and the older I get, the more I realise there’s always someone cheaper for clients to hire.

But you can’t keep competing that way. It’s a race to the bottom and won’t feed you beyond your next pay cheque.

If a potential client goes for the cheapest option, they weren’t right for me anyway. I’ve learned to say it doesn’t matter.

Their priorities weren’t aligned with what I have to offer. They weren’t looking for someone they can trust to do the job. They won’t come back after the first project.

### Trust can’t be bought, hired or outsourced.

Trust is something you earn by consistently delivering value. By not trying to sell more than is needed. By being reliable while getting the job done.

I find the same goes for side products, especially as an indie creator. Yes you could use a bunch of tricks to go for quick revenue, but the ultimate goal surely has to be the trust of some loyal customers.

That’s more important than a quick pay cheque.
