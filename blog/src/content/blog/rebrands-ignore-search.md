## Switching to a simpler, cleaner business name from your established one is always risky.

The board, and the design agency will consider it a win. The press will too, as it’s something to talk about — whether well received or not, it’s good for them.

But there’s a big question I think companies and startups are missing. Why do some rebrands ignore (or seemingly ignore) Google search?

This week ConvertKit has [announced](https://x.com/nathanbarry/status/1798745253610201269) it’s becoming… just Kit.

It’s actually very clever, and very well done. I applaud the move.

I really want it to succeed too, as I love the backstory ConvertKit and how they’re aimed at indie creators.

But I can’t help worry about Google search, with such a generic name.

It reminds me a bit of when Integromat became [Make](https://make.com/).

Again, really clever move and a big brand improvement.

However, since the move it’s become a nightmare to search for how-tos, tips and general information with such a generic word.

It’s almost like they became invisible on Google. Many Make users (me included) simply stuck to using the old name in Google for a while, but that never lasts long after a rebrand.

It’s also unhelpful for converting new users. Let’s say you heard about this app called Kit from a friend, or on a video or something. You try to Google it, but you have to filter out a lot of noise — pretty much everything else relating to the word ‘kit’.

It doesn’t build trust or confidence when you can’t find and isolate a brand name in searches. It adds frustration, and you may even give up trying.

Let’s hope [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) have thought about this, or will be thinking about it as they work through their move to the new name.

One of the best things they’ve chosen to do is ‘[rebrand in public](https://kit.com/)’, so we’ll get a front-row seat on decision making and all the thinking behind a lot of the changes.

As a designer I’m interested in the visual rebrand. As an indie creator, I’m very curious about the impact on the search side of things.
