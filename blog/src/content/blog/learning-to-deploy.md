I’ve recently added a new small skill. One I honestly thought wasn’t for me. Turns out, it’s not rocket science after all.

I learned how to deploy code from my computer to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), using GitHub as the bridge.

Why does this matter? Because this is how developers do it “properly”. You’re setting up a pipeline: write code, push to GitHub, let Cloudflare do the rest. It’s neat, repeatable, and a transferable skill.

Up to now I’ve always used either drag and drop on FTP or replied on no-code apps. 

So far I’ve deployed about four [small websites and apps](https://markbowley.me/launches). Some through GitHub, some via direct upload, just to get the reps in. None of them are complex or use a local build environment. That would be another step. 

So nothing groundbreaking, but the repetition builds confidence. Each time I hit “deploy” and see the site live in seconds, it clicks a little more.

I wouldn’t call myself a pro (yet), but I feel good that I’ve at least tried this.
