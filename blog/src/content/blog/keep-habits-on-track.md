Consistency is hard. We know this. Whether it’s exercise, writing, studying, or learning a new skill, we all need accountability. Or to share our progress and feel the wins.

But keeping track of those habits and challenges can feel like a chore.

That’s why I built Streaks Grid – a simple, visual way to track daily habits over 30 days. It’s a prototype for now, just me [trying out ideas](https://minitools.carrd.co/).

How it works:

1. **Add your habits:** anything you want to track, from journaling to coffee breaks. Just log each activity. 

2. **Visualise your streaks:** see your consistency at a glance in a colourful grid.

3. **Share your progress:** download a PNG of your streaks to post, celebrate, or motivate friends.

Unlike heavy apps or complicated trackers, Streaks Grid is lightweight, fun, and instantly shareable. It’s designed to make habit tracking less of a chore and more of a playful ritual.

Why it works:

- Visual progress motivates action.
- Sharing streaks creates accountability and friendly competition.
- Quick setup means no barriers, just start tracking today.

Tracking habits doesn’t have to be complicated or stressful.

Sometimes, just seeing your progress laid out visually – day by day – is enough to keep you going.

If you’re experimenting with a new routine, trying to stick to old habits, or just curious how consistent you really are, a simple streak grid can make the process a little more fun and a lot more satisfying.
