**Backlinks are the key to getting your SEO strategy off the ground. But getting those first ones under your belt can be a real frustration for many.**

The good news is you don’t need a big budget or a ton of connections to build a few quality backlinks.

You just need to get creative.

Here are three simple, low-cost ideas to boost your backlink profile using free platforms you might not have considered.

## **Carrd subdomains**

A little-known trick that’s flying under the radar are links you place on [Carrd](https://try.carrd.co/bowley) sites, using their subdomains. These links are *do-follow*, and the platform boasts a high domain authority (DA).

In simpler terms, this means Google will loves these links, even though you’ve made the pages yourself.

To use this to your advantage is easy. Launch multiple sites/pages on [Carrd](https://try.carrd.co/bowley) (at barely any cost) and publish on the subdomain option.

You don’t need to write a novel — just create simple, relevant content that ties into your main site’s subject. It could be one blog post, a list of resources, or a brief how-to guide. The key is to add value, not fluff. Then, link back to your main site in a way that feels natural and helpful.

The best part? Because you control the content, you can launch as many [Carrd](https://try.carrd.co/bowley) pages as you want, each one sending a valuable backlink to your main site.

## **Notion subdomains**

[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/od3nu076urdz) have recently made it easier to publish pages on subdomains too. So, much the same as with Carrd, it makes sense to publish relevant content with links back to you main site.

As this is all done in [Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/od3nu076urdz), it’s super easy and non-technical to spin up neat, nicely designed pages, and manage your content.

## **Substack publishing**

More than just a platform for newsletters , Substack is also a goldmine for backlinks. Like Notion and Carrd, Substack links are *do-follow* and have high DA, which makes them SEO gold.

If you’re thinking, “I don’t have a big Substack following!” here’s the thing: it doesn’t matter.

You don’t need a massive audience to benefit from Substack links. What you need is relevant content that links back to your main site.

Start a micro-newsletter focused on a niche topic related to your site. Write a few posts and naturally include links to your main site where it makes sense.

> Whether or not people subscribe, you’re still getting that sweet, high-DA backlink juice.
> 

Who knows? Your newsletter might even pick up some subscribers along the way. Even if it doesn’t, you’ve still scored some valuable backlinks that can help boost your site’s SEO.

By leveraging these three everyday platforms, you can build high-quality backlinks with minimal time, effort and expense.

The key is to create content that’s relevant and valuable, not just a random collection of links. So get creating, and watch your site climb the ranks.
