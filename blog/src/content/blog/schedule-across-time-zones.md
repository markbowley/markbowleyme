If you’re in a remote team, you know that scheduling across multiple time zones can be a headache.

You check your calendar, message a teammate, then double-check if it’s too early or too late for others. Maybe you ask Alexa ten times a day, “what time is it in X?”.

Even if you’re not on a team, often with a spread out international family it can be a challenge to keep track of what time it is for everyone. 

Instead, here’s a quick way to make it more painless.

Try [clocksdash.com](http://clocksdash.com/) – a lightweight dashboard prototype I made for remote teams.

Add your cities, add team mate names to clocks, share with your team, and avoid the 3 AM pings forever.

It’s just a prototype at the moment, but this is what you can do with it:

1. **Visualise all team times at a glance**
In the dashboard you can add each teammate’s city. You instantly see what time it is for everyone.
2. **Spot the overlap quickly**
Look for overlapping work hours, no mental math required. Day/night shading and emojis make it obvious when someone’s asleep. Office hours clocks pin to the top of the grid, for easy reference. 
3. **Share a single link**
Instead of sending multiple emails, share the dashboard link. Everyone sees the same view in their browser (teams can’t edit yet, only view a shared dash).
4. **Use it as your browser start page**
Keep it handy by going to settings and adding the URL as the standard home page for new tabs.

Keep it open every day, and scheduling becomes effortless.

Sure there are other tools that do something similar, but as a designer I wanted something that was very visual, and nice to use – not just a dull utility.
